# PS2 Mod Launcher

This is a custom launcher capable of bypassing the SOE launcher for Planetside 2 (and other Forgelight games).  It is capable of patching game files, Lua, and many other things to modify the Planetside 2 client.  It also contains a number of exploits that will force Planetside 2 to load any file you want it to load.  

Every single exploit contained in this package has been reported to SOE/DGC, some of them dating back to March 2013.  Responsible disclosure rules were followed, and SOE was notified about every issue contained in this package.  Consider all of these methods detectable by SOE's anticheat.  

The launcher is designed to hide itself from SOE's prying eyes.  This includes being named after SOE's launchpad and attempting to mask your user fingerprint (HWID).  I do not know for sure if any of that masking works (it probably doesn't), so don't trust it at all.  

This was released in hopes that others can create something awesome in addition to jseidelin's Network and Custom Server stuff. 

**Only use this code for good.**      



# Big Important Warning

Using this for Planetside 2 on live servers **will get you banned from the game**.  Consider it a proof of concept for many of these issues.  

The command line argument method was disabled by SOE back in 2013 when it was reported.  It's kept in the modlauncher for legacy reasons.
